============================

![alt text](http://www.projectanarchy.com/sites/default/files/Project%20Anarchy%20Logo.png "Project Anarchy")

Overview
--------

**Project Anarchy** is a complete end to end game engine and state-of-the-art toolset for mobile. Project Anarchy also comprises a vibrant game development community centred right at the Project Anarchy [homepage][1]. Project Anarchy includes an entirely free license to ship your game on iOS, Android and Tizen platforms.

We are providing a great deal of C++ and C# source access with the SDK, so to help the community build off of this easier, we have provided all the source with our SDK on GitHub so that people can more easily develop new plugins, fix bugs or even add new features!

Setup
-----

**You need to first install the full Project Anarchy SDK** to get all the assets for the samples and base data. You can get that from the [downloads page][2] on the Project Anarchy website. For a complete step-by-step guide to using this GitHub source access, please take a look at our page at [http://projectanarchy.com/git][3].
