#ifndef HKAI_PATH_REQUESTER_H
#define HKAI_PATH_REQUESTER_H

	/// Basic interface for requesting paths from hkaiWorld.
	/// The prePathSearchCallback is fired during hkaiWorld::stepPathSearches(), allowing you a chance to update
	/// any information in the request.
	/// For example, the start face index for A* might change from frame to frame because nav mesh cutting would change the face indices.
	/// If prePathSearchCallback() returns false, the request will not be fully processed by the hkaiWorld; instead it will be treated
	/// as a search failure.
