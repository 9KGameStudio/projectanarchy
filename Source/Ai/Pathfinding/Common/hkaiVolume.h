/// - An area with a specific material, independent of the original triangulation (a painter). See hkaiNavMeshGenerationSettings::m_carvers and hkaiNavVolumeGenerationSettings::m_carvers.
/// - An area with different generation settings (an override). See hkaiNavMeshGenerationUtils::m_overrideSettings.

/// Note that an hkaiVolume implementation can be 'inverted' - that is, the space considered 'outside' of the volume is 
/// bounded, and the space considered 'inside' the volume is unbounded. See \ref hkaiInvertedAabbVolume for an example.
