/// A utility for predicting the future trajectory of edge-steered characters.
///
/// Predictions are produced incrementally, one corner at a time. Each time
/// stepForward() is called, the next prediction is returned. Arbitrarily many
/// corners may be looked-ahead in this way.
/// 
/// The predictions are all made in the character's local coordinate space, as
/// specified by the positionSectionIndex argument to the constructor. If
/// future corner traversals take place in other nav mesh sections with 
/// different transforms, they will be transformed into the character's local
/// coordinate space. If the path passes through a user edge, the predictions 
/// for following corners will be "flattened" by transforming that part of the
/// geometry such that the two sides of the user edge match up. Likewise, for
/// wall-climbing meshes, changes in the up-vector will be flattened such that
/// the effective up vector for predicted corners is the character's local
/// up-vector.
/// 
/// Predictions are projected to an up-vector-normal plane. For instance, if
/// the character's local up-vector is +Y, the Y-coordinates of the hkVector4 
/// members of hkaiCornerPredictor::Prediction will be 0.
/// 
/// A hkaiCornerPredictor should not be kept between frames: changes to the
/// edge path (including those that hkaiEdgePath::updateTraversalState() may
/// cause) can invalidate the internal state of the predictor. Computation 
/// results are cached in the hkaiEdgePath, so constructing and using a new 
/// hkaiCornerPredictor on subsequent frames will not incur a performance
