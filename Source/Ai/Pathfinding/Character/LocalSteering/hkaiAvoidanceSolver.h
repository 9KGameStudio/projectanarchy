	/// down and turning only slightly, making them appear unhurried, focused, 
	/// or cooperative.
	/// 
	/// The dodging penalty should be greater than zero. Dodging penalties
	/// greater than 1 are allowed, but will generally not have a noticeably
	/// different effect than that of a dodging penalty of 1, and may cause
	/// problems if used in conjunction with a wall following angle which is
