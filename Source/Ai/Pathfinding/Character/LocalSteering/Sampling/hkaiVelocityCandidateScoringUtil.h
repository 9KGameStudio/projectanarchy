/// Static methods for calculating time-to-collision and time-to-resolution between an agent
/// and various obstacles.
///
/// The scoreXXXObstacle functions take a list of candidate velocities, and a list of time-to-collision
/// parameters. Each one determines the time to collision with the obstacle for each candidate velocity.
/// If there is a future collision along a given velocity, and the preexisting value for time to collision
/// passed in is greater than the new time to collision, it will be changed to the new time to collision.
/// If there is no future collision at that candidate velocity, or if the future collision would occur
/// after the preexisting time to collision value, the preexisting value is kept. As a result, all calls
/// to these functions can operate on the same TTC array in order to find, for each candidate velocity,
/// the earliest collision over all obstacles.
///
/// If the agent is currently penetrating an obstacle, these functions will instead return negated
/// time-to-resolution. Zero is never returned as a time-to-resolution if there is a current 
/// penetration, so all such values will be strictly negative. Moreover, the same less-than operation is
/// used to update the scores. As a result, penetrated obstacles will strictly dominate nonpenetrating 
/// obstacles: Following all scoreXXXObstacle calls, either all scores will be nonnegative, indicating 
/// that there is currently no penetration with any obstacle and that each score is the earliest time to 
/// collision for each velocity; or all scores will be negative, indicating that there is at least one
/// penetrated obstacle and that each score's absolute value is the latest time to resolution among all
/// currently penetrated obstacles.
///
/// Some caveats for penetration: Where practical, extremely large times-to-resolution will be returned
/// for velocities which resolve the penetration by going THROUGH (rather than around) the obstacle.
/// Time to resolution, however, may not always be accurate and may have discontinuities, particularly
/// during deep penetrations. It is intended to resolve only shallow penetrations. Additionally, it may
/// underestimate time to resolution in the case of overlapping obstacles, if an agent is penetrating
/// one obstacle but not another obstacle which that obstacle overlaps. In pathological cases, this could
/// potentially cause oscillations near the perimeter of obstacle overlaps, and could even force the agent
/// to go through the entire obstacle rather than resolve the penetration in the correct direction.
///
/// The derived scoring functions are used for obstacle structs.
/// In each case, the agent and the obstacle need not be coplanar, but will be treated as though 
/// they are coplanar (in a plane normal to the up-vector). All velocity candidates should be 
/// tangent to this plane.
