/// The hkaiUnique edges class provides a way to find all of the edges that index the same vertices. The vertex indices
/// can be in either order, for example an edge going from vertex 1 to vertex 2 is considered to match another edge which
/// goes from 2 to 1. Some algorithms can operate much more quickly if they only have to deal with edges going in one direction,
/// for example the hkaiBooleanOperation only needs to calculate the intersections of unique edges once.
///
/// The getNumEdges method returns the amount of unique edges in the hkaiEdgeGeometry. Given a unique edge index (from 0 to getNumEdges)
/// the getStartUniqueEdge and getUniqueEdge, methods can be used to find all of the edges that index the same vertex indices.
/// It is also possible given an edge index from the original hkaiEdgeGeometry to get the unique edge set it is in using
/// getUniqueEdgeIndex.
