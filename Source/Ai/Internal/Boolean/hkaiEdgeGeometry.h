/// hkaiEdgeGeometry represents the topology of geometry as an unordered list of edges. The representation allows
/// for a face to be convex, concave, have holes or be collections of disjoint islands of edges. An edge refers to a
/// start vertex (m_a) and an end vertex (m_b), and stores the index of the face it belongs to (m_face). It is also
/// possible to associate data with each edge via the m_data member.
///
/// The representation is the geometric type that the hkaiBooleanOperation processes. It is ideal for this processing as
/// the boolean can deal with arbitrary face descriptions, and outputs the resulting edges in arbitrary order.
///
/// The face 0 is special and should have no edges associated with it, and 0 in its m_data in the faces. The method
/// 'clear' which empties the contents of the hkaiEdgeGeometry, will set up the geometry with just face 0. Face 0
/// is taken to mean 'unconnected'. Thus in algorithms which determine edge connectivity, the face index 0 can be used to
/// specify 'unconnected', which can improve the performance of some algorithms significantly.
///
/// For processing hkaiEdgeGeometry, there are a set of classes that can be used to find a variety of information about,
/// faces, edges and vertices
///
/// hkaiFaceEdges - determines all the edges associated with each face.
///
/// All of these classes determine the data for all of geometry, as doing so makes the cost of the determination for each
/// primitive low. If the information is only needed for a single primitive, it may be more efficient to do a linear search
/// or use some other representation.
///
/// For hkaiEdgeGeometry to be valid it must fulfill a variety of constraints. For example each vertex indexed in a face
/// must be a start and an end vertex the same amount of times. The method 'checkConsistency' can determine if
/// an hkaiEdgeGeometry is consistent.
///
/// The m_faces array holds per face information. As it stands this is only per face user data. For a hkaiEdgeGeometry
/// to be valid every face indexed in an edge must exist in the m_faces array, even if it only holds zero in the m_userData.
