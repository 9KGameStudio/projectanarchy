/// The hkaiGeometryExtrudeUtil provides functionality to extrude hkaiEdgeGeometry. There are two styles
/// of extrusion handled via the 'extrude' and 'silhouetteExtrude'. The 'extrude' method does extrusion, by
/// looking for edges which are not shared in the original model. These edges are extruded using a quad that
/// runs from the original geometry, to a copy of the geometry placed at the extrusion distance. The technique
/// works fine for a single sided surface to extrude, but not for a closed shape, as all edges will be shared,
/// and thus nothing will be extruded.
///
/// The 'silhouetteExtrude' looks at shared edges whose faces which face in the opposite directions to the extrusion
/// direction. These edges along with edges that are not shared are then used as the boundary edges for the
/// extrusion. The technique works correctly with closed geometry. There is an issue when there are faces that contain the
/// extrusion direction vector. In this situation the extrusion edge can be determined to be either the top or the bottom of
/// the face - and may flip between the two due to numeric precision issues.
