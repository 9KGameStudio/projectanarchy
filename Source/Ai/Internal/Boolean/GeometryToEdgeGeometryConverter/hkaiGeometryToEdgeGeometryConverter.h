// This class is copied from the hkdMeshToGeometryConverterImpl class.

/// The hkaiGeometryToEdgeGeometryConverter converts hkGeometry objects into hkaiEdgeGeometry. hkaiEdgeGeometry
/// is a representation which allows for a face to be concave and potentially contain holes. hkGeometry objects only
/// consist of Triangles - therefore to allow for a more compact and more rapidly processable hkaiEdgeGeometry it is
/// possible to have the conversion merge co-planar triangles together to make a larger face.
///
/// Merging (see _tryAddNeighbor) is enabled with the mergeCoplanarTriangles parameter to convertTriangleMeshToGeometry method. Determination
/// of co-planarity is controlled by the 'm_edgeAngularDistance' and 'm_planeEpsilon' properties of an instantiation of
/// hkaiGeometryToEdgeGeometryConverter. Note that merging is only performed on triangles that are connected via an edge -
/// i.e., two disjoint islands of locally connected coplanar triangles won't be merged into a single face, even if the islands are coplanar.
///
/// Also note that merging will only take place between triangles with the same value in the 'm_material' member.
