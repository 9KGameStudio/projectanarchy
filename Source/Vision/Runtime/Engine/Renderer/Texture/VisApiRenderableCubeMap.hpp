/// \brief
///   Class for offscreen cube map render/depth stencil targets
/// 
/// A renderable cube map is a special type of cube map texture object: Unlike regular
/// VTextureCubeObjects, its faces (in DX10/11 also the complete cube) can be render or depth stencil
/// targets which can e.g. be passed to a VisRenderContext_cl object using the
/// VisRenderContext_cl::SetRenderTargetCubemap/SetDepthStencilTargetCubemap methods. Otherwise,
/// renderable cube map textures can be used just like normal cube maps.
/// 
/// Note that a renderable cube map texture that is the current render or depth stencil target can
/// not be bound as a texture at the same time (in other words, don't render a shader/scene
/// element which has the render target of the current render context as input texture).
/// 
/// A VisRenderableCubeMap_cl object has to be set up using the VisRenderableTextureConfig_t
/// structure.
/// 
/// On Xbox360, a VisRenderableCubeMap_cl allocates memory in the internal EDRAM buffer as a render
/// target. In order to set up data for predicated tiling, use the appropriate members of the
/// VisRenderableTextureConfig_t structure.
/// 
/// VisRenderableTextureConfig_t::m_bRenderTargetOnly can be used to specify whether a
/// VisRenderableCubeMap_cl is intended to be used as a a texture, or whether it is simply a
/// temporary surface. The latter is often desired for depth-stencil targets, for instance, and
/// typically consumes less memory.
/// 
/// VisRenderableTextureConfig_t::m_bResolve is useful e.g. for multisampled render targets which
/// can't be directly used as textures on many platforms. VisRenderableCubeMap_cl objects created
/// with m_bResolve set to true will internally create a non-multisampled resolve target for the
/// texture. If the associated render context uses the automatic resolve feature, the Vision Engine
/// will handle all necessary resolve operations for you. Note that there may be limitations
/// regarding resolve operations depending on the graphics hardware.
/// 
/// m_bResolve is enabled by default for Xbox360, since this platform can't render
/// directly to a texture.
/// 
/// Using VisRenderableTextureConfig_t::m_bIsDepthStencilTarget and an appropriate surface format,
/// you can specify whether the VisRenderableCubeMap_cl is to be used as a color or depth stencil
/// target.
/// 
/// In DX10/11, you can use the VisRenderableTextureConfig_t::m_bRenderTargetArray member to specify
/// whether the renderable cube map is to be used as a render target array, or a set of six
/// separate 2D render targets. The former is useful if you e.g. want to select the render target
/// in the geometry shader.
