/// \brief
///   Class for offscreen 2D render/depth stencil target arrays
/// 
/// A renderable texture array is a special type of texture array: Unlike regular
/// VTexture2DArrayObjects, it can be a render target or depth stencil target that can e.g. be
/// passed to a VisRenderContext_cl object using the VisRenderContext_cl::SetRenderTarget method.
/// Otherwise, renderable texture arrays can be used just like normal texture arrays.
/// 
/// Note that a renderable texture array that is the current render or depth stencil target can not
/// be bound as a texture at the same time (in other words, don't render a shader/scene elementh
/// which has the render target of the current render context as input texture).
/// 
/// A VisRenderableTexture2DArray_cl object has to be set up using the VisRenderableTextureConfig_t
/// structure.
/// 
/// The VisRenderableTextureConfig_t::m_iArraySize property specifies the number of 2D slices
/// (array elements) in the texture.
/// 
/// On Xbox360, a VisRenderableTexture2DArray_cl allocates memory in the internal EDRAM buffer as a
/// render target. In order to set up data for predicated tiling, use the appropriate members of
/// the VisRenderableTextureConfig_t structure.
/// 
/// VisRenderableTextureConfig_t::m_bRenderTargetOnly can be used to specify whether a
/// VisRenderableTexture2DArray_cl is intended to be used as a a texture, or whether it is simply a
/// temporary surface. The latter is often desired for depth-stencil targets, for instance.
/// 
/// VisRenderableTextureConfig_t::m_bResolve is useful e.g. for multisampled render targets which
/// can't be directly used as textures on many platforms. VisRenderableTexture2DArray_cl objects
/// created with m_bResolve set to true will internally create a non-multisampled resolve target
/// for the texture. If the associated render context uses the automatic resolve feature, the
/// Vision Engine will handle all necessary resolve operations for you. Note that there may be
/// limitations regarding resolve operations depending on the graphics hardware.
/// 
/// m_bResolve is enabled by default for Xbox360, since these platforms can't render
/// directly to a texture.
/// 
/// Using m_bIsDepthStencilTarget and an appropriate surface format, you can specify whether the
/// VisRenderableTexture2DArray_cl is to be used as a color or depth stencil target.
