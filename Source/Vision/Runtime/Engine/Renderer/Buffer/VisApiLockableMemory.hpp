/// \brief
///   A utility class for encapsulating and safely freeing graphics memory.
///
/// This class manages pre-allocated graphics memory, which can then
/// be locked for read/write access and/or safely released. In all cases, a label mechanism is used to 
/// grant access only if the memory is not currently in use by the GPU.
///
/// If usage information is not provided via the BeginUse() / EndUse() API, a 
/// conservative labeling strategy is used.
///
/// \note
///   GPU memory is to be allocated outside of this class.
///
/// \platforms
///   PS3, PS Vita, Wii U

  /// \brief
  ///   Lock the GPU memory for reading and/or writing.
  /// 
  /// This method provides safe access to GPU memory for reading and/or writing. By specifying appropriate

  /// data transfer.
  ///
  /// If GPU usage information is provided via the BeginUse() / EndUse() API, it is used to control access to this resource.

  /// the GPU until the last applicable GPU operation.

  ///   In order to optimize performance, the intended use can be indicated through a combination of the following flags:
  ///   \li VIS_LOCKFLAG_DISCARDABLE: Specify this flag if _all_ data in the memory area is to be overwritten.
  ///     This allows for replacing all internal data with freshly allocated memory in order to avoid having to
  ///     wait for the GPU to finish using this resource. The current memory will be released as soon as it is not
  ///     in use anymore.
  ///   \li VIS_LOCKFLAG_READONLY: Specify this flag if there will be no data written to the memory area. This allows
  ///     for skipping GPU data upload.
  ///   \li VIS_LOCKFLAG_NOOVERWRITE: Specify this flag if the locked memory area is guaranteed not to be in use 
  ///     by the GPU anymore. This allows for direct access to this memory area without having to wait for any labels
  ///     to be reached.
  ///   \li VIS_LOCKFLAG_REPLACE_ALL: Specify this flag if the complete _locked_ memory area is to be overwritten.
  ///     Depending on the platform, this allows for skipping GPU data download into CPU-accessible memory.
