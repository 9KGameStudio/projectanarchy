public:
  /// \brief
  ///   Constructor of the VGpuResource class.
  /// 
  /// \param pParentManager
  ///   Resource manager this resource will be added to.
  ///
  /// \param uiSize
  ///   Size of this resource in bytes.
  ///
  /// \param uiUsageFlags
  ///   Can either be VIS_MEMUSAGE_STATIC, VIS_MEMUSAGE_STATIC_UNMANAGED, VIS_MEMUSAGE_STREAM, or
  ///   VIS_MEMUSAGE_DYNAMIC. In general, you should use STATIC for data that is specified
  ///   only once and then never changed. STREAM should be used for data that is modified or
  ///   re-specified in run-time, but used for rendering more often than it is updated. DYNAMIC is
  ///   the best solution for data that has about a 1:1 update to render ratio. The difference
  ///   between VIS_MEMUSAGE_STATIC and VIS_MEMUSAGE_STATIC_UNMANAGED is that an unmanaged buffer
  ///   will never be double-buffered by the graphics API. It may therefore consume less memory on
  ///   some platforms with separate memory pools, but you will have to take care of lost device
  ///   handling etc. yourself. It is generally recommended NOT to use
  ///   VIS_MEMUSAGE_STATIC_UNMANAGED.
  ///   In addition to one of these basic settings (which can't be combined), you can specify 
  ///   VIS_MEMUSAGE_UAV_BYTEADDRESS or VIS_MEMUSAGE_UAV_STRUCTURED to determine the way this buffer
  ///   is addressed when using it as an unordered access resource in a compute shader in DX11.
  ///   Finally, specify VIS_MEMUSAGE_UAV_DRAWINDIRECT, VIS_MEMUSAGE_APPEND, and/or VIS_MEMUSAGE_COUNT
  ///   if appropriate for the intended use in a pixel and/or compute shader in DX11.
  ///
  /// \param uiBindFlags
  ///   Specify bind flags for this resource depending on its intended usage. Possible values are:
  ///   \li VIS_BIND_INDEX_BUFFER: Allows this resource to be used as an index buffer.
  ///   \li VIS_BIND_VERTEX_BUFFER: Allows this resource to be used as a vertex buffer.
  ///   \li VIS_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE: Allows this resource to be bound as a shader resource via an
  ///     appropriate shader resource view (DX11 only).
  ///   \li VIS_BIND_UNORDERED_ACCESS_VIEW: Allows this resource to be bound for unordered access 
  ///     via an appropriate unordered access view (DX11 only).
  ///   \li VIS_BIND_STREAM_OUTPUT: Allows this resource to be used as a target for stream
  ///     output operations (DX11 only).
  ///
  /// \param bHasSysmemCopy
  ///   Specifies, whether this resource has a shadow copy of its data in system memory. This should
  ///   be chosen if read operations from the buffer are desired. However, this additional copy
  ///   results in twice the memory consumption and typically results in lower update performance.
  ///
  /// \param bSafeCleanUp
  ///   Specifies, whether internally a label is used for a safe clean-up of the encapsulated resource.
  ///   This is not necessary when it is guaranteed that the resource is not in used by the GPU when 
  ///   it is destroyed. (This applies only to platforms which support VLockableMemory.)

  ///
  /// \note
  ///   Depending on the target platform, the selected configuration of usage flags, bind flags, and/or
  ///   the use of a system memory copy has implications on the accessibility to this resource.
  ///   For example, not using a system memory copy means that resource data cannot be read on GLES2 and that 
  ///   a resource with VIS_MEMUSAGE_STATIC cannot be locked on DX11.
