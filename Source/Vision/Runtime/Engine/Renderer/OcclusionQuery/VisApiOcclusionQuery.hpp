/// \brief
///   This class encapsulates hardware occlusion query functionality. The class itself does not hold a hardware query
///   but instead holds an index to an internal hardware query pool as long as a query is in progress.
///
///  To use the query call 'BeginOcclusionQuery' and anything that is rendered until 'EndOcclusionQuery' will be added to the query's result.
///  Note that there can only be one query active at any time, so it is important to end a query before 
///  calling 'BeginOcclusionQuery' on another query.
///
///  Calling 'GetResult' or 'CheckQueryQueue' will result in a check to the queue of actual hardware queries. These will
///  be checked in chronological order and those that are already finished will have their result written back to their
///  corresponding 'VOcclusionQuery' object. This ensures that the actual hardware queries can be reused as soon as possible,
///  even if a 'VOcclusionQuery' never or rarely retrieves its results.
///
///  This functionality depends on the back pointer within the hardware queries to map them to the corresponding 'VOcclusionQuery' objects.
///  Therefore, it is important that active 'VOcclusionQuery' objects are not moved in memory. Do not store them in containers like VArray<VOcclusionquery>
///  which move the memory on reallocation.
