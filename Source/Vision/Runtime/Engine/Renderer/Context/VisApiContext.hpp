///   Container class for managing render contexts
/// 
/// This container class contains functionality for managing and sorting render contexts. It serves as a base class for
/// the VisRenderContextManager_cl and the IVRendererNode classes.
///
/// The IVRenderContextContainer class also takes care of priority handling: It sorts the
/// registered VisRenderContext_cl objects inside a single IVRenderContextContainer instance by their priorities, so the VisionApp_cl::Run method can
/// render them in the appropriate order. This is important since render contexts may depend on
/// each other (e.g. the main scene render context may depend on the result of a shadow render context).

/// yourself to optimize it for your use-case.
/// Please refer to the source code of the VisionApp_cl class for further reference.

/// renderer nodes typically do not register any render contexts with the global VisRenderContextManager_cl.
