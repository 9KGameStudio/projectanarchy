/// \brief
///   Interface for physics objects
/// 
/// \note
///   Several parts of the Vision Physics API are obsolete without explicitly being marked as such
///   and should not be used directly. When in doubt, use the functionality provided by the
///   vHavokPhysicsPlugin directly instead of relying on the generic interface.
/// 
/// The IVisPhysicsObject_cl class is the interface for physics objects. It doesn't specify any
/// interface functions but rather serves the purpose to have a typed pointer instead of a void
/// pointer for accessing physics objects.
/// 
/// Physics modules have to implement their own physics object class based on this interface.
///
