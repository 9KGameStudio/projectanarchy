/// \brief
///   Vision resource manager base class.
/// 
/// An instance of this class represents a resource manager for a single resource type.
/// 
/// This class is derived from VResourceManager and implements the file IO overridables.
/// 
/// A resource manager owns a list of resources of type VManagedResource and provides functionality
/// to handle the resources, e.g. checking for memory limits etc.
/// 
/// The engine provides resource manager for each type of managed resource, e.g. models, textures,
/// skeletal  animations etc.
/// 
/// The engine resource manager can be accessed via the VisResourceSystem_cl class
/// (Vision::ResourceSystem). The VisResourceSystem_cl class also allows the user to register 
/// custom resource managers which will show up in the resource viewer as well.
/// 
/// To add resources to the manager, derive your own resource class from VManagedResource and pass
/// a pointer to the manager in the constructor.
