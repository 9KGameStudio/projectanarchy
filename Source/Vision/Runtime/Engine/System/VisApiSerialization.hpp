/*
-> Add the changes of new vision archive version here
  Version 029 (Vision SDK 7.7)
  - Switched PhysX binding to component system. New serialization version of vPhysXJoint class required.

  Version 028 (Vision SDK version 7.6)
  - Cleaned up class structure (VisTypedEngineObject_cl...VisBaseEntity_c)

  Version 025 (Vision SDK version 7.1)
  - Object key in VisObject3D_cl replaces entity key etc.

  Version 024 (Vision SDK version 7.0)
  - AutoRemove property on VisApiAnimEvent

  Version 022 (Vision SDK version 7.0)
  - constraint changes

Version 021 (Vision SDK version 6.3)
  - object3D unique IDs
  - light source version number

Version 020 (Engine Version 6.0)

Version 014 (Engine Version 5.1)
  - entity: new animation state serialization

Version 013 (Engine Version 5.1)
  - entity: shadow casting flag fix

Version 012 (Engine Version 5.1)
  - Scale does not get serialized anymore in VisObject3D_cl (already serialized in VisBaseEntity_cl)
  - VisLightSource_cl class does not serialize position and orientation data anymore (now part of VisObject3D_cl)
  - Introduced new class hierarchy for VisBaseEntity_cl class:
      New Class Structure:                        Old Class Structure:
      ---------------------                       --------------------
      VisTypedEngineObject_cl                     VisTypedEngineObject_cl
      VisBase_cl                                  VarManager_cl
      VisObject3D_cl                              BaseEntity_cl
      VarManager_cl                               VisBase_cl
      BaseEntity_cl                               VisObject3D_cl
      VisBaseEntity_cl                            VisBaseEntity_cl  
  
  - Introduced new class hierarchy for VisLightSource_cl class:
      New Class Structure:                        Old Class Structure:
      ---------------------                       --------------------
      VisTypedEngineObject_cl                     VisTypedEngineObject_cl
      VisBase_cl                                  VisLightSource_cl
      VisObject3D_cl                              
      VisLightSource_cl

Version 010 (Engine Version 4.7.11)
  Use 32bit light masks

Version 011 (Engine Version 4.8)
  Added ProcessZeroWeighting variable to animation component

Version 010 (Engine Version 4.8)
  Serialize parent in VisObject3D_cl class

Version 009 (Engine Version 4.5.14)
  Load time based events in model interface

Version 008 (Engine Version 4.2.0)
  Break compatibility to older versions

Version 007 (Engine Version 4.0.5)
  Added Object3D flag using euler angles

Version 006 (Engine Version 3.6.0):
  Added lightsource color animation custom curves (VisLightSrc_AnimColor_cl class)

Version 005 (Engine Version 3.5.8):
  Added m_bIsStatic member to the VisionPhysicsObject_cl class 

Version 004 (Engine Version 3.5):
  Added pOldAnimSequence member to the VisAnimationUnit_cl class 
  Added pSkeletalAnim/pMuscleAnim member to the VisModelAnimSequence_cl class

Version 003 (Engine Version 2.4):
  Added m_iAbsPhaseTime member to the VisModelAnimPhase_cl class 

Version 002 (Engine Version 2.3):
  First version of the serialization in Vision

Version 001 :
  This version has been skipped since the default value of the loading version is 1.
  By skipping this version we can easily detect whether the game programmer forgot
  to set the loading version for an archive (as done in the following function)
*/


// the following function needs to be updated in case an engine version can't load old
// archives anymore
inline BOOL VisCheckForValidArchive( int iLoadedArchiveVersion, int iEngineArchiveVersion )
{
  // check whether SetLoadingVersion has been called for the archive (which is required)
  if ( iLoadedArchiveVersion == 1 )
    return FALSE;

  // check whether the archive version is higher than the currently supported archive version of the engine
  if ( iLoadedArchiveVersion > iEngineArchiveVersion )
    return FALSE;

  return TRUE;
}
