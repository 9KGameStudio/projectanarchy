/// \brief
///   Module System Child class
/// 
/// This class is the module system child class for the child side. If you derive your class from
/// this class, then your class will automatically behave as a child. This class offers a couple of
/// NotifyFunctions which will be called at certain times by the parent, which allowes your class
/// to react on certain events.
/// 
/// In order to register your class as a child class of an entity, you have to derive your class
/// from this VisModuleSystemChild_cl class and either pass the parent in the constructor, or set
/// it later by calling the ModSysConnect function.
/// 
/// In the Vision Engine the VisObject3D_cl class behaves as a parent (thus all entities), which
/// allows you to easily attach other objects to entities. Many classes of the API already work as
/// modules, which means that they are derived from this class and are children of their parent
/// class (e.g. VisScreenMask_cl, VisLightSource_cl etc.)
