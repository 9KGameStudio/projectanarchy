/// \brief
///   Base animation control class with common control attributes and methods
/// 
/// An animation control represents an instance of an animation being played. Several controls can
/// use the same animation data (sequence) and play it at a different time, speed and direction.
/// 
/// This parent class performs the time calculation, event handling and motion delta for all
/// animation types (subclasses).
/// 
/// The VisAnimControl_cl is virtual but includes all functionality that a standard control needs.
/// So you can derive classes from it to play every kind of animation you want. The base class will
/// compute the current sequence time, update the motion delta, send occurring messages to its
/// listeners, and call the Sample function that you have to overwrite in the subclass to get the
/// actual result.
/// 
/// However, you can also use the two predefined classes VisVertexAnimControl and
/// VisSkeletalAnimControl.
/// 
/// VisAnimControl_cl derives from VisAnimEventListener_cl. Use the event handler functionality 
/// to register your own classes as listeners for events that occur in the animation sequences event
/// list or that you have added to the controllers event list by hand.
