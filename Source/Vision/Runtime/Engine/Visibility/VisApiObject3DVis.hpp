/// \brief
///   Class used to handle visibility zone assignment of dynamic scene elements.
/// 
/// A VisObject3DVisData_cl instance can be added to a VisObject3D_cl object (or instances of
/// classes derived from VisObject3D_cl) in order to allow the VisObject3D_cl to keep track of its
/// assignment to visibility zones.
/// 
/// By default, VisObject3DVisData_cl objects will automatically be added to an internal list of
/// modified instances whenever the VisObject3D_cl they belong to moves. At the end of the update
/// loop of the VisionApp, these objects are processed, and their visibility zone assignments are
/// updated.
/// 
/// Each VisObject3DVisData_cl (and, therefore, each VisObject3D_cl) can belong to an arbitrary
/// number of visibility zones.
/// 
/// Note that VisObject3DVisData_cl objects can transition between visibility zones directly
/// connected to each other without restrictions. For zones connected through portals, however,
/// zone transitions require the VisObject3DVisData_cl to move through the portal between the two
/// zones. If this is not the case, incorrect zone assignments (and thus incorrect visibility
/// classifications) will result.
/// 
/// If objects need to be able to move "through walls", use the RecomputeVisibilityZoneAssignment
/// method to ensure that the zone assignment is recomputed.
