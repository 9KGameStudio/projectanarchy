/// \brief
///   Class describing a visibility zone.
/// 
/// A visibility zone is basically a volume containing scene elements. During visibility
/// determination, the visibility collector (see IVisVisibilityCollector_cl) traverses the
/// visibility zones and determines which zones and which scene elements inside these zones are
/// visible. Visibility zones are either connected through portals or directly. Portals are
/// typically used in indoor scenes, where a large part of the scene is always occluded. Direct
/// connections between visibility zones can be used to subdivide large open spaces and therefore
/// improve visibility determination performance.
/// 
/// Scene elements can be in zero, one or multiple visibility zones at the same time. Transitions
/// of scene elements through portals or into neighboring visibility zones are handled
/// automatically using the functionality provided by the VisObject3DVisData_cl class.
/// 
/// Visibility zones have to be added to the active scene manager (see IVisSceneManager_cl) before
/// they are used.
/// 
/// Visibility zones are always represented by an axis-aligned bounding box. While a visibility
/// zone MAY NOT overlap any of the visibility zones directly connected to it (though it has to
/// touch them), it MAY overlap visibility zones connected through portals. This is due to the fact
/// that portals are basically determined by the scene geometry and can be at arbitrary locations
/// and arbitrary angles.
/// 
/// Note that all portals connected with a visibility zone have to be completely inside the
/// bounding box of that visibility zone.
/// 
/// Custom implementations may derive classes from VisVisibilityZone_cl and implement some of the
/// virtual functions.
