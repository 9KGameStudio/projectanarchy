/// \brief
///   Portal class used for describing portal-based visibility relations in a scene.
/// 
/// A portal can be used to link two VisVisibilityZones_cl objects together. If this is the case,
/// and the eye point is in the source zone, it is only possible to see objects in the target zone
/// through the portal.
/// 
/// Portal-based visibility is typically well-suited for indoor scenes.
/// 
/// The portal's vertices have to be provided in counter-clockwise order; the portal plane's normal
/// has to point in the view direction. Portals are unidirectional, so if it should be possible to
/// see visibility zone A from zone B and vice versa, you need to set up two portals (one with A as
/// source and B as target, and one with B as source and A as target). Make sure to specify the
/// vertices in correct (counter-clockwise) order.
/// 
/// Valid portals have to contain at least three vertices. Note that it is not recommended to
/// create portals with very high vertex counts, since this will adversely affect performance.
