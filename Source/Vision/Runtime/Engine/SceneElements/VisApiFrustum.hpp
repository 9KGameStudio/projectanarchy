/// \brief
///   Frustum class for n-sided frustums (perspective/orthographic), optionally supporting capping
///   planes.
/// 
/// This class provides functionality for easily creating n-sided frustums
/// (perspective/orthographic) and using them for overlap checks (e.g. visibility tests).
/// 
/// The render collection classes provide functionality for filtering collections of entities,
/// static scene elements etc. according to the spatial relation to a frustum.
/// 
/// Frustum planes have to point outside of the frustum. For performance reasons, no sanity check
/// is performed; the best way to verify the orientation of frustum planes is to draw the frustum
/// using the Vision::Game.DrawFrustum method with normals enabled. The normals have to point away
/// from the frustum.
/// 
/// If a near clap plane is contained in the frustum, it is always at plane index 0.
/// 
/// If a far cap plane is contained in the frustum, it is at plane index 0 if no near cap plane is
/// present; otherwise, it is at plane index 1.
