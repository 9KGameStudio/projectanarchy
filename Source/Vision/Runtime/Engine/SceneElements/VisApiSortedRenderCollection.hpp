/// \brief
///   RenderCollection base class
/// 
/// The RenderCollection_cl class is the base class for a number of subclasses providing
/// functionality for handling collections of scene elements. The various subclasses are used in
/// many methods of the VisRenderLoopHelper_cl class, and will typically be found in custom render
/// loop implementations.
/// 
/// The elements in a render collection are not reference counted.
/// 
/// In general, the order of elements in a Render Collection should not be changed, since the
/// Render Collections returned by the methods in VisRenderLoopHelper_cl are frequently pre-ordered
/// for reasons of performance and visual correctness (e.g. translucent geometry). Any change in
/// the order of the elements inside a Render Collection is likely to result in a performance drop
/// or even visual artefacts.
