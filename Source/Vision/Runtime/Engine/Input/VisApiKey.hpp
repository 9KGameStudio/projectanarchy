/// \brief
///   Class for accessing keyboard status. The global instance of this class can be accessed via
///   Vision::Key.
/// 
/// The key codes VGLK_XXX are virtual keys to provide method/layout independent key codes.
/// 
/// To translate a VGLL_XXX code to ASCII character(s), do a lookup in a table using VGLGetKeyTable
/// directly.
/// 
/// Alternatively you can also use DirectInput scancodes directly using the corresponding *_SC
