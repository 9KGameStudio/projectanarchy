  /// \param sensitivity
  ///   Mouse sensitivity. This functionality is currently not implemented, though setting a value
  ///   of 0 will mean "set default sensitivity".

  /// \param method
  ///   The preferred method for input. The folowing constants are supported:
  ///   \li VGL_WINDOWSINPUT: Use Windows mouse input,
  /// 
  ///   \li VGL_DIRECTINPUT: Use DirectInput mouse input

  /// 
  /// \note
  ///   On Win32 based systems it is usually the best to use the VGL_WINDOWSINPUT method during the
  ///   development and the VGL_DIRECTINPUT method for release builds. While the VGL_WINDOWSINPUT
