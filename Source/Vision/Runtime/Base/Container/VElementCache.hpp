/// \brief
///   Template class for managing a list of cached elements.
/// 
/// Re-using objects by keeping a list of cached instances is a useful concept to avoid memory
/// fragmentation during runtime.
/// 
/// Template parameters are the class type of the instances and the size of the cache.
/// 
/// The cache has a static size.
/// 
/// The user can request new objects or remove objects analogous to the 'new' and 'delete' operator.
/// 
/// If the user requests an object it is either taken from the cache or created via the pure
/// virtual AllocateObject function. Thus object creation and delete functions have to be
/// implemented by derived classes.
