/// \brief
///   This struct is returned if a pointer access is desired but not allowed, because the data layout has changed.
///
/// If the compiler complains about this class, it means that you are trying to get the pointer to some data,
/// which was linear in memory in previous versions of the Vision Engine, but not anymore in this version.
/// As such, it is not possible to take that pointer and operate on the data, as before.
struct ThisDataIsNonLinear_PointerAccessDenied {};


/// \brief
///   [internal] A helper class that is used by hkvMat3 and hkvMat4 to prevent people from trying to get
///   a pointer to the internal data of those classes.
///
/// This was allowed in previous versions of the Vision Engine, but since the layout of the matrix classes
/// has changed from row-major to column-major, it is not possible to access that data in the same way as before.
/// Therefore this class will return the struct 'ThisDataIsNonLinear_PointerAccessDenied' whenever such an
/// access is detected, to ease porting code that uses the old classes to the new code.
///
/// For performance reasons hkvMat_ElementFloat is only used on windows in debug builds, it is not enabled on any
/// console build or in release builds (as it is a debugging only feature).
