// If this is defined several math functions will strictly validate their input data (in debug mode only).
// E.g. a function that requires a normalized vector as input, will check this and fire an assert, if
// that prerequisite is not met.
// Since this can often lead to a large number of asserts being fired (due to invalid data being passed
// to these functions, especially during startup), this switch is disabled by default.
// The Vision Engine is tested with this and thus should not assert with it being enabled.
// Enabling this switch will allow to more easily find usage errors that might result in corrupted states.
