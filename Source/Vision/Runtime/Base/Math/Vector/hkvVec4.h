///   This class represents a 4-component vector.
///
/// The 4th component is used in all operations, and never ignored.
/// That means normalize, multiply with a 4x4 matrix etc. all use the
/// 4th component properly. Therefore you must ensure that it contains
/// proper values.\n
/// In most situations it will make more sense to use hkvVec3 instead.
/// hkvVec4 should mostly be used when working with float RGBA color, or with
/// shader registers. For points and directions always use hkvVec3 instead.
