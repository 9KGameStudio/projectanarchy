/// \brief
///   Worker function for byte swapping of complex data structures.
/// \param pData
///   pointer to the start of the data on which to perform endian switching
/// \param pEnd
///   pointer to the end of the data. May be \c NULL to skip sanity checking.
/// \param format
///   the format of the data to work on. See below for a detailed description.
/// \param blockRepeatCount
///   number of times to repeat the current block (usually used in recursive calls
///   of this function)
/// \param updatedFormat
///   used for recursive calls to EndianSwitchWorker, so the callee can advance
///   the position in the format string
/// \return
///   a pointer to the address following the last modified data element
///
/// The format string can contain the following elements:
/// - \b numbers: a number prefixed to a format specifier or a group repeats that
///   data element or group the specified number of times.
/// - \b groups: format specifiers can be grouped with parentheses. If then prefixed
///   with a number, the repetition affects the whole group.
/// - \b q: Quad word (8 bytes)
/// - \b d: Double (8 bytes, switched the same way as a quad word)
/// - \b i: Integer (4 bytes)
/// - \b f: Float (4 bytes, swapped the same way as an integer)
/// - \b s: Single (2 bytes)
/// - \b c: Char (1 byte, no swapping)
///
/// The following example demonstrates a complex format pattern:
/// \verbatim q4cii3(s2cf)d \endverbatim
/// - Switch one quad word
/// - Skip 4 bytes
/// - Switch two integers (could, of course, also be written \c 2i)
/// - Repeat the following group three times:
///   - Switch one short
///   - Skip 2 bytes
///   - Switch one float
/// - Switch one double
///
/// \note
///   It is usually better to call the higher level functions, such as 
///   LittleEndianToNative().
