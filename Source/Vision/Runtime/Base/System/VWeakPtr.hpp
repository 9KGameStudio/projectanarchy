/// \brief
///   Weak reference target class that is used by weak pointers to retrieve a valid pointer to the
///   referenced object.
/// 
/// The VWeakRefTarget class template has the purpose of providing a valid pointer to a referenced
/// object. Since the weak reference target is referenced counted, the weak pointer instances use
/// the target to retrieve a valid pointer to the referenced object.
/// 
/// Any class which wants to support weak pointers has to provide a weak reference target instance
/// and has to reset the reference target when the object gets destroyed (VWeakRefTarget::Reset).
/// Since the ref target is ref counted, it is important that the object holds a smart pointer to the ref target as well.
/// In the sample code below it uses the nested templates VSmartPtr<VWeakRefTarget<MyObject> > m_spWeakRefTarget to accomplish that.
/// 
/// \sa VWeakPtr
/// 
/// \example
///   \code
///   // sample class which offers weak reference functionality
///   class MyObject
///   {
///   public:
///     MyObject::MyObject()
///     {
///       // m_spWeakRefTarget = NULL; // not required since it is a smart pointer
///     }
///
///     VWeakRefTarget<MyObject>* MyObject::GetWeakReference()
///     {
///       if (!m_spWeakRefTarget)
///       {
///         //Create the weak reference target
///         //It will be reference counted and shared between all objects that reference this
///         m_spWeakRefTarget = new VWeakRefTarget<MyObject>(this);
///       }
///       return m_spWeakRefTarget;
///     }
///     MyObject::~MyObject()
///     {
///       //reset the weak ref itself
///       if (m_spWeakRefTarget)
///        m_spWeakRefTarget->Reset();

/// \brief
///   Weak pointer class that stores a weak reference.
/// 
/// The weak pointer class template stores a "weak reference" to an object. In comparison to usual
/// pointers a weak pointer returns NULL if the referenced object has been destroyed.
/// 
/// The weak pointer uses a weak reference target for retrieving the latest pointer to the object.
/// You can assign a pointer to a weak reference target class to the weak pointer and use it
/// exactly like you used the original object pointer. See VWeakRefTarget for more information
/// about setting up your own weak reference target.
/// 
/// \sa VWeakRefTarget
/// 
/// \example
///   \code
///   // use a weak pointer like a usual pointer
///   VWeakPtr<MyObject> m_wpRef = pObject->GetWeakReference();
///   m_wpRef->DoSomething();
///   // m_wpRef will return NULL if the object was deleted
///   delete pObject;
///   ASSERT( m_wpRef == NULL );
