/// \brief
///   Interface of a serialization proxy object
/// 
/// A proxy object is a typed object that performs full serialization and creates the real object
/// in the serialization code.
/// 
/// This mechanism is well suited for serializing shared resources, because full serialization only
/// shares the pointer references inside the binary archive. For example, if an entity model should
/// be de-serialized, the deserialization should look for an already loaded model in the resource
/// manager.
/// 
/// This class consists of a single virtual overridable, GetInstance(). This function is called in
/// VArchive::ReadProxyObject to get to the real object. The GetInstance() implementation could for
/// instance perform a lookup into the resource manager before actually creating a new resource.
///

/// \brief
///   Interface of a serialization proxy creator
/// 
/// A proxy creator is a pure interface that allows to create a proxy object through its one and
/// only CreateProxy() function.
/// 
/// This allows to share resources in an archive with resources that have been loaded already and
/// even allows to serialize objects that are not derived from VTypedObject.
/// 
/// If the resources would deserialize themselfes directly, unique resource instances would be
/// created even if the resource has already been loaded before the archive has been opened.

  /// \brief
  ///   Overridable that returns a proxy object that is able to serialize this class
  /// 
  /// The VArchive::WriteProxyObject function calls this function to gather a proxy object for
  /// serialization.
  /// 
  /// Since the IVSerializationProxy class is reference counted, the VArchive class takes care of
  /// releasing all proxy object instances that have been created during a serialization session.
  /// 
  /// This function is the counterpart to the IVSerializationProxy::GetInstance function.
  /// 
  /// \return
  ///   IVSerializationProxy *pObj: New proxy object
  /// 
  /// \note
  ///   The VManagedResource class is derived from IVSerializationProxyCreator because shared
  ///   resources (models, animation files, bitmaps ...) rely on this feature.
