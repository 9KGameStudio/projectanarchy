/// \brief
///   Interface that receives a callback function notification
/// 
/// The virtual OnHandleCallback method gets called when any one of the callbacks this handler
/// is registered for is triggered.
///
/// Since a handler can be registered to multiple callbacks at the same time, the implementation
/// of the OnHandleCallback method has to find out which callback was actually triggered. For this
/// purpose, the m_pSender member of the callback data object can be evaluated.
/// 
/// A convenient way to register a handler to a callback is using the += operator, see example.
/// 
/// Callback handlers always have to be de-registered from all callbacks before they are destroyed.
/// 
/// The engine provides some commonly used global callbacks via Vision::Callbacks (see
/// VisCallbackManager_cl class)
/// 
/// For instance, to update a class instance once per game tick, the class can implement the
/// OnHandleCallback function and  register itself to the global
/// Vision::Callbacks.OnUpdateSceneBegin function.
/// 
/// Callbacks can also be used for other notifications, e.g. OnButtonPressed events in a GUI
/// system.
