/// \brief
///   Low level memory manager interface
///
/// All memory managers for allocations in main memory have to be derived from this interface. Vision's default memory manager
/// (VMemoryManager_CRT) as well as the optimized SmallBlockMemoryManager (VSmallBlockMemoryManager) are naturally also derived
/// from IVMemoryManager.
///
/// In order to use a custom memory manager, simply create a manager by implementing IVMemoryManager. To install a custom memory
/// manager, pass a pointer to it to the global SetVMemoryManager() function. Once this is done, all system memory management functions
/// will be forwarded to the custom implementation.
///
/// In order for this to work correctly, it is essential that the custom allocator has a way to determine whether an allocation
/// was performed by itself or a previously registered memory manager. For instance, the default memory manager may have been used
/// for allocating memory inside static initializers (i.e., before the custom memory manager was registered). These allocations need
/// to be freed by the default memory manager, so your custom implementation should forward all deallocations of memory blocks it does
/// not know about to the default implementation (VMemoryManager_CRT).
