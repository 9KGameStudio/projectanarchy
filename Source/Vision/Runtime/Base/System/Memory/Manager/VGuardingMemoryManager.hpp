/// \brief
///  A memory manager that catches accesses to out-of-bounds array indices and freed pointers.
///
/// On non-Windows platforms, this class is typedef'd to the default memory manager class.
///
/// Every allocation performed with this manager is surrounded with access protected pages. The allocation
/// is right-aligned inside the accessible pages, so any accesses to memory past the allocated region
/// will crash immediately. The memory before the allocation is padded with a magic value, which allows
/// catching invalid writes immediately before the allocated region.
///
/// The most recently freed allocations are not immediately released, but made access-protected instead
/// which allows finding invalid accesses to freed pointers.
///
/// Using this manager has a very high memory and CPU overhead.
///
