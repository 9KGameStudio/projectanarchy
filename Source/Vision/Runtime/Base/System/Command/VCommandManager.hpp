///   Class that manages the command type information of the complete application.
/// 
/// Because we now have command type information per plugin and applications,  consisting of many
/// plugins, we have a class that manages the commands type  information of the complete
/// application. An object of the VCommandManager  is not filled automatically with the
/// information. The application can/has to add each plugin with function calls in the code.
/// 
/// The manager has a own list type information (references) which is the sum of all plugins added
/// to that manager instance. There are functions to add  and remove plugins and to get access to
/// the command type information in  multiple ways.
