/// \brief
///   Container class for collision data used by the VCollisionMesh classes
/// 
/// It contains three flat lists of collision data of different levels:
/// \li The node list contains all the nodes of the scene graph. Each node is implemented as a
///   VCollisionNode object (q.v.) which contains the name, type, world matrix and blind data of
///   the node, as well as references to its child nodes (these nodes MUST be present in the node
///   list as well). Also, nodes of specific types may contain a reference to one of the collision
///   meshes in the mesh list of this data class.
/// 
/// \li The mesh list contains all collision meshes in the scene. Each mesh is implemented as a
///   VSimpleCollisionMesh32 object (q.v.) which contains the vertices for the mesh and for each triangle
///   in the mesh it contains three indices to the triangle's vertices and a reference to one of
///   the collision surfaces in the surface list of this data class to describe the triangle's
///   surface.
/// 
/// \li The surface list contains all collision surfaces in the scenes. Each surface is implemented
///   as a VCollisionSurface object (q.v.) which simply contains the material name of the surface
///   it represents. VCollisionData is derived from VChunkFile so that it can save and load its own
///   data to/form a file. It overloads the OnStartSaving and OnStartChunk callbacks from
///   VChunkFile to achieve this. A SPECIAL NOTE ON ADDING NODES, MESHES AND SURFACES: When
///   creating a node, mesh or surface then you'll have to add it to the data structure TWO TIMES.
///   One time with the AddNode/AddMesh/AddSurface function in this class and one time with a
///   function in the parent object to which you want to connect it (i.e. surfaces to meshes,
///   meshes to nodes, child nodes to parent nodes).
