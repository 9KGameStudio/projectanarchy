/// 
/// \brief
///   Component that listens to animation events of the owner entity triggered by the transition
///   state machine and the animation sequences of the owner entity.
///
///   This component registers itself as an event listener to the root animation control of
///   the parent owner entity. VAnimationEventEffectTrigger derives from this class in order 
///   to listen to animation events added in the vAnimTool.
/// 
/// \note
///   Please note that this class derives from IVAnimationEventTrigger so animation events 
///   triggered by the Vision animation system (coming from the animation file) will also be
///   processed next to the events added in the vAnimTool. Inherit from this class in case
///   you want to listen to animation events both from the animation file and the vAnimTool 
///   (vTransition file).
/// 
/// \note
///   The owner entity will need to have a transition state machine component attached with 
///   a valid vTransition file that contains animation events.
