/// \brief
///   Object component class that can be used to get a playable character (controlled via keyboard)
///   up and running very quickly, e.g. for rapid prototyping.
///
/// The playable character component can be used to quickly get a playable character up and running
/// in your game, mostly for prototyping purposes. It is not meant to be used for a final game.
///
/// Requirements
///  - The owner entity needs to have a physics object to process motion/rotation delta. This can e.g.
///    be done by adding a vHavokRigidBody component to the owner entity.
///  - The owner entity needs a VTransitionStateMachine component, since the state machine is used for
///    animation playback.
///
/// The component provides parameters for the various animations (walk, run, idle). The animation playback
/// is performed with a transition state machine (VTransitionStateMachine). The WASD and SHIFT keys are
/// automatically mapped to move the character in the scene.
