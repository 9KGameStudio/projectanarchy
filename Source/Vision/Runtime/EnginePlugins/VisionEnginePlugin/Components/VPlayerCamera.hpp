/// \brief
///   linked to the parent entity.
/// 
/// This component can be attached to an entity to observe its movement. 
/// Basically this camera has two different modes - free orbit and follower. In the
/// free orbit mode you can move the camera freely around the parent entity by moving
/// the mouse. In this mode you can also enable zooming which can be controlled with 
/// the mouse wheel. The follower mode aligns the camera orientation to the parent
/// entity and follows its rotation. In this mode you can control the smoothness of
/// the camera movement, meaning the ease in/out of the camera alignment.
/// When setting up a player camera component via code, the relevant public member variables
/// (InitialYaw,...) have to be set before attaching the component to an entity.
