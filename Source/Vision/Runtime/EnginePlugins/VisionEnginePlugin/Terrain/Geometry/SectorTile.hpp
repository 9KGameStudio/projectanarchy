/// \brief
///   VSectorTile defines a tile inside a sector. Tiles have more fine-grained information about the terrain such as decoration references or holes.
///
/// However, tiles are not the granularity for the render draw calls. Draw calls are reprsented by class VTerrainSectorMeshPageInfo.
/// The number of tiles per sector can be specified at terrain creation time. Typically this is something like 32x32. Tiles also define the granularity for holes in the terrain.
