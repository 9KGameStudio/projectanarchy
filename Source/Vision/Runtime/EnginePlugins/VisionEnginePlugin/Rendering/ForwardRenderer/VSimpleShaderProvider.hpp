/// \brief
/// The class is used by the renderloop to manage the various lighting shaders.
///
/// It implements a specialized shader provider, that will choose reduced shaders for improved performance.
/// By default only surfaces with VSM_Auto set are affected. 
/// Choosing bOverrideManualShaders = true will extend this behavior to all surfaces.
/// 
/// Normally the VSimpleShaderProvider works by assigning vmDiffuse to all surfaces, 
/// but additionally it will search for techniques with the "SimpleShader" inclusion tag.
/// That way the user can write specific shaders that are only used on low-end hardware for instance.
///
/// If bUseSimpleShaders == false at creation the VSimpleShaderProvider will behave exactly as VisionShaderProvider_cl.
