/// \brief
///   Base class for all shadow map components that can be attached to light sources.
///
/// By attaching a shadow map component to a dynamic light source, dynamic shadowing using shadow
/// maps is enabled for that light source. 
///
/// Depending on the type of light source (directional vs. spotlight vs. point light), you will
/// need a different specialization of this class (VShadowMapComponentPoint vs. VShadowMapComponentSpotDirectional/ 
/// VMobileShadowMapComponentSpotDirectional).
///
/// Shadow Maps are generated using a "deferred" approach for forward as well as for deferred rendering, except 
/// for the mobile forward renderer: 
/// First, the depth texture is rendered from the light's point of view. Then, this information
/// in conjunction with the scene depth in view space is used to compute shadowing values for all
/// relevant pixels, which are stored in a single texture (typically the size of the render target,
/// or a quarter of that size) which is called the "shadow mask". This texture is generated prior to applying the actual lighting
/// information. The lighting pass itself then only needs to take the shadowing information from
/// this texture into account (a simple lookup and multiplication to mask the light intensity).
/// 
/// For mobile forward rendering the shadow map will be directly used in the lighting pass.
///
/// Note that shadow map components are specific to a single renderer node: If you have multiple renderer nodes, you will have
/// to attach multiple shadow map components - one per renderer node - to your light sources.
