vHavokCollisionListener:

- An additional "m_uniqueIdCounter" for couting all collisions and supplying the collision infos
  with an unique collision ID => See CollisionEventsDemo (Havok Samples)

- Do we need to scale the relative veloctiy of the contact point of a havok collison to Vision
  scale? => See vHavokCollisionInfo_t
  
- Toi contacts, which are just created if two objects hit with high velocity and the interaction 
  of both objects is flagged as continuous => Right now only normal contacts are supported
  
  
  
vHavokShapeFactory:

- Documentation for CreateShapeFromStaticMeshInstances

- Do we need separate tables for cached conves shapes and static meshes?




18.12.09 - Notes:

1) InitRbFromFile(..., vHavokRigidBody::InitTemplate* initTempl); => Pointer instead Reference?

2) InitRbFromFile: File needs to be specified relative to Binary. No default setup.

3) InitRbFromFile: Don't pass CreateHkRigidBody, etc. Creates RB directly.

4) vHavokPhysicsModule: IVisPhysicsObject_cl *CreatePhysicsObject(...); return NULL?
=> Create Component + warning
