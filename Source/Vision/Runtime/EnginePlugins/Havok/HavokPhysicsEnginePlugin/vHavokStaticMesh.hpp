/// \brief

///
/// The vHavokStaticMesh class takes one or multiple Vision static mesh instances as input,
/// creates a Havok rigid body for these meshes and throws them into the Havok simulation.
///
/// Creation and deletion of vHavokStaticMesh instances is in the responsibility of the
/// Havok physics module. It is not recommended to create vHavokStaticMesh instances in
/// game code, since the module will take care of that.

/// Please note that the constructor does not yet add the object to the simulation. One
/// has to call the ::Init functions for that purpose.
