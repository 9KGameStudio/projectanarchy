/// \brief
///   Vision scene preprocessor
///
/// This is a very specific processor that preprocesses a vGeom2 scene for later exports. It basically runs
/// over a vGeom2 scene and alters it in ways to prepare it for Vision file format specific exports. It was
/// written mainly to translate custom user properties to node-data (filling a vGeom2 scene proved to be
/// easier across multiple tool environments this way, for some options).
///
/// Furthermore it checks whether texture paths have to be altered (e.g. for texture animations), and will
/// probably be extended every once in a while, as it is a nice abstraction for specific scene details, etc..
/// It is a good idea to keep this on your processor stack as first processor, if you intend to use the
/// VGProcessor_VisionExporter processor, as well.
///
/// This processor uses qhull for some computations, thus introducing an external dependency on qhull.
