/// \brief
///   Portal class
///
/// A portal is basically a polygon describing the shape of the portal, and a
/// front / back ID pair. IDs matching the triangle properties' visibilityID
/// are considered being in the same visibility zone as the portal's front or
/// back. A portal is thus bidirectional.
/// Again, it's up to the user to define the space the portal's shape will be
/// in, however, the Vision bakend code interprets it as parent space (equals
/// world space in this case).
